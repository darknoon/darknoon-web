_Update: Take is no longer available_

I'm pleased to finally talk about my latest project: Take<. It's a video filter app that is really simple.

So simple it just shoots video with the filter applied and saves it to your camera roll.

You can read more about it over on the [official site](http://takethevideo.com).

Take has been my project / labor / frustration / obsession for the last year or so. When I started working on it, I never expected quite the complexity I encountered when trying to make a video filter app that I would be happy with. Now that it's starting to accumulate real users, I'll be taking feedback and looking for ways to improve and extend it.

In any case, look for more filters and some bug fixes in the near future.

Thanks everyone!

P.S. Especially those beta testers who send feedback and comments.
