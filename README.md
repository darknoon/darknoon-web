## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd darknoon.github.io/
    yarn develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    this site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

    Open this directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
