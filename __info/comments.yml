  Hi.
  
  This is very nice, thanks for the port.
  
  I fixed the mouse coordinate issue by the way,
  
  	update(port, (self.inputX+1)*self.imageBounds.size.width*0.5, (self.inputY+1)*self.imageBounds.size.height*0.5, self.inputPressure);
  
  
  on line 42 in DNYellowtailRender.m
  
  Ill see what can be done about antialiasing. Could always do supersampling perhaps? Anyway, its very nice!

  I am trying to get this to work and it seems that the test wont load up or anything I installed it in the plugins and even tried the patches folder.
  
  this is what I get when I run the test

  @JamisonHiner The install location should be "~/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins" instead of "~/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins"

  Prompted by a post on Kineme site <a> I downloaded the source code and compiled the same for 10.6 active architecture only and found that the plugin is running beautifully.

  @memedai Xcode's build scripts run them through pngcrush automatically, so all you need to get them back into the iPhone format is to add them to your project. If you want to do it manually, IIRC, the command is:

  So Classics would be even more fun for me if I could add my own books to it (since I have a jailbroken phone).
  
  Have you tried to do this?
  
  I did, but it ignored my additions - it seemed like the app had a hardcoded maximum number of books built in or something. I was able to replace all of the contents of one of the existing books - the cover image, the PDF files, the Info.plist - but I had to leave the name of the folder bundle unchanged or else the app wouldn't see it. 
  
  I tried adding my custom book's bundle name to the CSBookOrdering list in com.classicsapp.classics.plist, but it didn't work. Any ideas?

  1. If you resize the webview to grab more content, it doesn't draw instantly an there is no callback to tell you when it's done drawing\r\n\
  \r\n\
  2. Web content in general doesn't play very well with fitting on a page or finding the proper size of a webpage so you can grab all of it.\r\n\

  All of this will be pretty pass\xC3\xA9 once CoreText and NSAttributedString come to iPhone though. They're available on iPad, so I imagine it's only a matter of time. (OS 4.0?)"

  Useful deconstruction, thanks for putting this out there.
  
  If I understand what you are looking to do with rendering an arbitrary view hierarchy (webview, whatever) there's a pretty simple method I've been using for sometime...
  
  Here's a sample app the renders a UIWebView and slaps the result into a a UIImageView.

  When you say:
  
  "Unlike the HTML/WebKit rendering on the iPhone, there does exist a simple way to get an image from a PDF page."
  
  I wonder. How do you do that? I have some experience programming the iphone and I don't know how to do this. Would you mind giving me some pointers?

content: I have sucessfully added 4 of my own eBooks to Classics.  It's easy.  All you have to do is set the page size in Word to that of the PDFs, and set about half inch margins at the top and bottom so text won't get cut off. Paste in each chapter and export each as the numbered PDFs (Word 2007 has PDF export).  Be sure to make the title pages too!  Finally, since I don't mind playing with vector art, you can easily make a book spine and back shadow in Inkscape, then paste on the book's actual cover.  And for the best part, copy onto you're jailbroke iDevice into the Classics' app sandbox.

  rahlvyas - you export an environment variable before launching it from the shell or a script.  E.g.:
  &gt; export CA_COLOR_OPAQUE=1
  &gt; /Path/To/Simulator &amp;
  
  I first heard of this technique Jake Behren's interview at <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/supersized-360idev-podcast-feat-chris-heintz-mike-clark-jessica-kahn-jake-behrens-peter-bakhirev/" rel="nofollow">MobileOrchard Episode 360iDev Episode 27</a>, it's great.  Some of the other debug options like "Flash updated regions" are useful when considering how drawrect: could be finetuned too.
