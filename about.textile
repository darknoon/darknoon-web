h1. Andrew Pouliot

Programmer, designer, artist.

I have been building apps for the iPhone since the release of the official SDK in 2008 and apps for iPad since its announcement. I work with filmmakers, tiny startups, airlines, internet companies, international retailers, and my friends to build apps for the iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads.

I specialize in making smooth, 60-fps, responsive UI.

Design isn't skin deep. I work throughout the apps' architectures to achieve responsiveness and timely, beautiful display of graphics and information. Often this requires asynchronous image processing, optimized animations, and performance-tuned c or c++ code. I have a particular interest and expertise in hardware accellerated 2D/3D graphics in OpenGL ES 2.0 and Core Animation. Other topics of interest include efficent networking, geolocation, and web services.
