Programmer, designer, artist.

<div class="rightside">


I have been building apps for the iPhone since the release of the official SDK in 2008 and apps for iPad since its announcement. I work with filmmakers, tiny startups, airlines, internet companies, international retailers, and my friends to build apps for the iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads.

I specialize in making smooth, 60-fps, responsive UI.

My work is design, from how the app looks and feels to how the internals are architected. Performance optimization is about ensuring and timely, beautiful display of graphics and information.

Often this requires asynchronous image processing, bouncy animations, and performance-tuned c or c++ code. I have a particular interest and expertise in hardware accelerated 2D/3D graphics in OpenGL ES 2.0 and Core Animation.
